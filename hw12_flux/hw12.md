# Questions and Answers

### 1. What is FLUX?
**FLUX** is an application architecture pattern used for building client-side web applications. It was introduced by Facebook to manage the flow of data in React applications. FLUX follows a unidirectional data flow pattern and consists of the following components:

- **Actions**: Payloads of information that send data from the application to the dispatcher.
- **Dispatcher**: A central hub that manages all the actions and passes them to the appropriate store.
- **Stores**: Containers for application state and logic that listen for actions from the dispatcher and update accordingly.
- **Views**: React components that listen for changes in the store and re-render the UI.

### 2. What is Redux? How do you use it with React components?
**Redux** is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React. It provides a single source of truth (a global state) for the entire application, making it easier to manage and debug state changes. Redux is based on three core principles:

- **Single Source of Truth**: The entire state of the application is stored in a single object.
- **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is by emitting an action.
- **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action and return a new state.

To use Redux with React components, you need to install Redux and React-Redux, create a Redux store, wrap the React application with a provider, and connect the React components to the Redux store.

### 3. What is a reducer?
A **reducer** is a pure function in Redux that determines how the state of the application changes in response to an action. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state object. Reducers handle the logic of state transitions based on the action received.

### 4. How do you choose between ContextAPI and Redux for global state management?
When choosing between **ContextAPI** and **Redux** for global state management, consider the following:

- **ContextAPI** is suitable for simpler applications or those with minimal global state. It is easier to set up and does not require additional libraries. It is ideal for managing a small amount of state that doesn't change frequently.

- **Redux** is better suited for complex applications with a large amount of global state. It provides powerful debugging tools like Redux DevTools and supports middleware, making it easier to manage asynchronous operations and side effects. Redux enforces a more structured and scalable approach to state management.

### 5. What is redux-thunk and why do you want to use it?
**redux-thunk** is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action object. This function can then perform asynchronous operations before dispatching an action.

You might want to use redux-thunk because it allows for more complex action logic, such as conditional dispatching or chaining multiple actions. It simplifies handling asynchronous operations in Redux, like fetching data from an API, and enables side effects within action creators, which can be crucial for managing complex workflows in an application.
