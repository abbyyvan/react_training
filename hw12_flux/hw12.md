# Interview-Style Questions and Answers

### 1. What is FLUX?
FLUX is an architecture pattern that Facebook introduced to manage how data flows through React applications. It emphasizes a unidirectional data flow, which helps keep everything predictable and easier to debug. The key components are **Actions** (which trigger events), the **Dispatcher** (which routes those events), **Stores** (which hold the application’s state), and **Views** (which are the React components that update based on the state).

### 2. What is Redux? How do you use it with React components?
Redux is a state management library that's commonly used with React. It helps manage the state of your application in a predictable way by centralizing it in one place, known as the store. The idea is that the entire app’s state is held in this one store, and the only way to change the state is by dispatching actions. The flow of data is unidirectional, making it easier to debug and reason about. 

To use Redux with React, you typically create a store to hold the state, wrap your React app with the `Provider` component to give it access to the store, and then connect your React components to the Redux store so they can read the state and dispatch actions.

### 3. What is a reducer?
A reducer is a pure function in Redux that handles how the state of your application changes in response to actions. When an action is dispatched, the reducer looks at the current state and the action, then returns a new state. Reducers are essential in Redux because they define how your state should evolve over time based on the actions that are dispatched.

### 4. How do you choose between ContextAPI and Redux for global state management?
Choosing between ContextAPI and Redux depends on the complexity of your application. If your app has a small amount of global state that doesn't change much, ContextAPI is usually sufficient. It’s simpler to set up and doesn’t require any external libraries.

However, if your application has a lot of state or you need more advanced features like middleware for handling side effects (e.g., asynchronous operations), then Redux is a better choice. Redux also provides better debugging tools, like the Redux DevTools, which can be a big advantage in more complex applications.

### 5. What is redux-thunk and why do you want to use it?
redux-thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to handle asynchronous logic in your action creators. Normally, action creators return plain objects, but with redux-thunk, they can return functions. This is useful when you need to do things like make API calls or run other asynchronous tasks before dispatching an action. It gives you more control over the timing of actions and helps manage side effects more effectively in your application.
